# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
   User1 = Teacher.create([{ first_name: "Star Wars" }, { last_name: "Star Wars" } { phone: "Lord of the Rings" }])
   Teacher.create(name: "Luke", movie: teacher1.first)
